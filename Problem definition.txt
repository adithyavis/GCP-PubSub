Cloud Pub/Sub & Cloud Functions

Use case: 
Use Cloud Pub/Sub and Cloud Functions to create an instance, copy an object from one bucket to another bucket and after copying the object, delete the instance.

Steps:
Create a pub/sub topic.
Create a cloud function.
Send json as a pub/sub message which includes, instance name, machine-size, object-path.
After json being sent to pub/sub, cloud function should get triggered.
After cloud function being triggered, instance should get created with values passed in json message.
Copy object from one bucket to another, after copying is done, instance should get deleted.

Note:
1. json can be like:
{
	instance_name : "xyz",
  	instance_size :"n1-standard-1" ,
	object_path : "gs://path/to/object"
}

2. Can use any environment i.e python or node


Expected Outcomes :
1. Understanding and implementation of cloud functions and cloud pub/sub.
2. Instance creation and deletion with apis.
3. Usage of startup scripts.
4. Understanding of serverless architecture and its working.
